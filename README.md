Hi Ms. Aren,

Please be informed that I'm always trying to be better version of myself in performing my task everydaythanks to your 'somewhat brutal comment' during my job interview. Well except for remembering direction, sorry po but I cant do that hahahaha.  I'm always looking forward to learned more from you. 

Happy birthday ma'am :) Wishing you a good health and happiness always! God bless you po ^_^

Enjoy your day!

Regards,
Nadz

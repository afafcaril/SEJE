Hi Ms. Aren,

Please be informed that I'm always trying to be better version of myself in performing my task everyday (Well except for remembering direction,sorry po but I cant do it hahahaa)... thanks to your 'somewhat brutal comment' during my job interview. I'm always looking forward to learned more from you. 

Happy birthday ma'am :) Wishing you a good health and happiness always! God bless you po ^_^

Enjoy your day!

Regards,
Nadz
